  CrossValidated = F,

}
\arguments{
\item{data_mx}{\itemize{
\item Normalized, imputed, z-scored data. Data matrix includes features as rows, samples as columns.
}}

\item{cases}{\itemize{
\item vector of index or column names corresponding to cases
}}

\item{kmx}{\itemize{
\item number of top perturbed features to use as input node set. If useS set as TRUE and S is provided, kmx can be NULL.
}}

\item{zThreshold}{\itemize{
\item z-score threshold where values outside of range (-zThreshold,zThreshold) are considered abnormal.
}}

\item{ranksList}{\itemize{
\item list of ranks. If CrossValidated is TRUE, provide ranks calculated from network folds with names corresponding to the left-out sample, and a ranks object calculatd from the network learned from all training samples named by "0".
}}

\item{igList}{\itemize{
\item list of background networks. If CrossValidated is TRUE, provide network folds with names corresponding to the left-out sample, and a network learned from all training samples named by "0".
}}

\item{CrossValidated}{\itemize{
\item set as TRUE if cross-validated method were used when learning background networks.
}}

\item{useCasesMean}{\itemize{
\item Use mean cases profile for calculating initial disease module.
}}

\item{thresholdDiff}{\itemize{
\item parameter passed on to singleNode.getNodeRanksN.
}}
}
\value{
a list of best compressed node set, p value.
}
